Project 3 Spec
Part 1
	TURN IN
		-Actor.h : NachenBlaster, Star class declarations; constants.
		-Actor.cpp : Implementation
		-StudentWorld.h
		-StudentWorld.cpp
		-May modify the string literal "Assets"

	Actor is a base class:
		constructor
		derived from graphobject
		doSomething()

	Star, derived from Actor
		move()
		must not duplicate functionality across classes

	NachenBlaster, derived from Actor
		derived from Actor, or derived of derived from Actor
		constructor
		image ID of IID_NACHENBLASTER
		doSomething(): 
			lets the user pick a direction by hitting a directional key
			if (!move off) 
				update location

	StudentWorld
		constructor
		destructor: free dynamically allocated data
		init()
			create a NachenBlaster
			insert it into the space field
			create Stars
			insert them
		move()
			doSomething()
			dont check die
			only with Stars and NachenBlaster
			insert new Star at far right
		cleanUp()
			free dynamic data from init() or move() (Stars and NB)

	Part 1 Does the following
		User hits enter to begin
		display a space field with NB and stars
		move NB around
		NB in front 
		stars drift to left

Game Details
	Student World (initial)
		m_life = 3
		m_level = 1
		m_nStars = 30
		space field:
			256px*256px
			GameConstants.h
	Level
		to complete level N: destroy T = 6 + (4 * N) ships
	size of star (0.05-0.5)
	NachenBlaster at a new level
		hitpoints = 50
		m_nCabbage = full
		m_nTorpe = 0
	Tick
		every flying object doSomething(): move/fire/fall/die/drop
		check if NB has died
		delete dead flying objects
			destroyed objects
			collided projectiles
			flown off the edge
			picked up goodies
		update game stats
			lives
			health (x/50hitpoints)
			score
			level
			cabbage percent
			torpe number
			Lives: 3  Health: 100%  Score: 24530 Level: 3 Cabbages: 80% Torpedoes: 4
		check if complete a level
			if so end the current and advance
		introduce new star
			1/15 chance
			at x = VIEW_WIDTH-1
			size between 0.05-0.5
		introduce new alien ship
			D = how many destroyed at the level?
			R = remaining alien ships that must be destroyed (T - D)
			M = 4 + (0.5 * currentLevel)
			if (current on screen < min(M, R))
				introduce
			which type?
				S1 = 60
				S2 = 20 + currentLevel*5
				S3 = 5 + currentLevel*10
				S = S1 + S2 + S3
				S1/S: Smallgon
				S2/S: Smoregon
				S3/S: Snagglegon
				x=VIEW_WIDTH-1, and a random y between 0 and VIEW_HEIGHT-1, inclusive
